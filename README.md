# Traffic Patterns Prediction



# Summary

This project attempts to predict the AADT traffic volumes for each road within a road network, first utilizing a quadratic programming (QP)
optimizer, secondly by using neural networks.

This project was developed as the project for CS 6140 (Machine Learning), completed during the Spring 2021 semester at Northeastern
University.


# Approach

Unless specified, all commands will be assumed to run from this project's main directory.


## Data origin

This project utilizes map data obtained from OpenStreetMap, which is exported using the same XML format provided by OpenStreetMap.
AADT values must be provided as a list using the following JSON format (ID tag may be excluded):
```json
{
    "AADT":[
        {
            "ID":"a1",
            "latlon":[0, 0],
            "AADT μ":100,
            "AADT σ":20
        },
        {
            "ID":"b2",
            "latlon":[0, 1],
            "AADT μ":200,
            "AADT σ":40
        }
    ]
}
```

Where:
- μ: AADT mean
- σ: AADT standard deviation


## Quadratic Programming optimization

### Data pre-processing

The OpenStreetMap and AADT data must be preprocessed into a JSON output via:
```bash
python3 QP/preprocessing.py \
    --osm $OSM_FILE_FILEPATH \
    --aadt $AADT_JSON_FILEPATH \
    --output $OUTPUT_JSON_FILEPATH
```

For example:
```bash
python3 QP/preprocessing.py \
    --osm examples/Niles/Niles.osm \
    --aadt examples/Niles/Niles_AADT.json  \
    --output test/example1.json
```

Use the *--show* flag to show a map as well as node and road counts.


If requesting information about how the flags in more detail, run:
```bash
python3 QP/preprocessing.py --help
```


The following types of ways are not used when calculating traffic values:
* aeroway: Cannot drive (unless way is a highway)
* cycleway: Cannot drive (unless way is a highway)
* footway: Cannot drive (unless way is a highway)
* railway: Cannot drive (unless way is a highway)
* waterway: Cannot drive (unless way is a highway)
* highway/service/driveway: Not a road designed for continuous driving
* highway/service/parking_asile: Not a road designed for continuous driving

### Convex optimization:

Run the quadratic optimizer (OSQP solver) using the above JSON preprocessed output (note, the *--verbose* flag will have no effect on the
actual output) in order to obtain a JSON output which will contain nodes and road information, as well as the AADT calculated for each road.
Run via:
```bash
python3 QP/QP.py \
    --input $PREPROCESSING_OUTPUT_FILEPATH \
    --output $OUTPUT_JSON_FILEPATH
```


Assuming an output being *test/example1.json*, run via:

```bash
python3 QP/QP.py \
    --input test/example1.json \
    --output test/output1.json
```


Use the *--verbose* flag to show a map of each road, colorcoded depending on the AADT value.


If requesting information about how the flags in more detail, run:
```bash
python3 QP/QP.py --help
```

The solver has been found to return inaccurate results when enforcing strict constraints when setting *adaptive_rho = False*[4]. Therefore,
this has not been strictly enforced. Instead, if any negative values are found, these are solved using a second QP optimizer with the
same constraints, but which attempts to reduce the sum of squared errors with respect to the values generated by the first optimizer.


### Multi-map preprocessing and optimization

It is possible to rapidly generate as many copies as desired of a map, each with the AADT values generated randomly using the original AADT
values as the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution. This is useful in order to rapidly generate input data for neural
networks or any other algorithm.

This can be done through the bash script *generate_multiple_QP_solutions.sh* via:

```bash
./generate_multiple_QP_solutions.sh $OSM_FILE_FILEPATH $AADT_JSON_FILEPATH $OUTPUT_JSON_FILEPATH $num_copies $multi_processed_dir
```

where the *$multi_processed_dir* represents the directory output location for the AADT values including the final '/', the final output will
be stored in a directory of the same name but ending in *_output*.


For example:
```bash
./generate_multiple_QP_solutions.sh examples/Niles/Niles.osm examples/Niles/Niles_AADT.json test/example1.json  20 test/multiple/

```

### Running the neural network

Simply install the requirements by running `pip install requirements.txt`,
then run the network with 
```bash
python3 nn/main.py --epochs 10 --model gcn --data-folder <path-to-data-folder>
```

The path to the data folder points to a folder created by the qp solver with subfolders "multiple" and "multiple_output".

For other command options run `python nn/main.py --help`.
