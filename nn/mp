Individual tasks


From what I understand, this project is an extension of other work Carlos has done before, but I think he will better explain that in his summary.

Grania
- Writing and experiments for Section 4.4 "Calculated AADT using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)"
- Reasoning behind use of MSE for error

Carlos
The completion of Carlos' work was a prerequisite for most of my work to get done, so I had to rely on him doing so quickly. He did to a very reasonable amount.
He was also the expert on the project, as it is based on the field he already researches. If I could offer one small critique, I think it would be that we did not take enough time to have him share his knowledge with us. Grania and I should have asked him to present his prior research to us, rather than just reading up on related papers we could find on our own and asking him questions.
Carlos also did:
- Data preprocessing for QP solver
- QP Solver used in code
- Graphicsl displaying of maps
- All of section 3.1


Me
- Data preprocessing for GCN/MLP
- Implementation, research for GCN, MLP
- Most of Previous Work section
- "Considered Neural Networks" part of background, explanation of GCNs
- Section 4.3 minus the maps, which were drawn by the same code Carlos used to draw his own maps for the QP
- Half of conclusion
- Most of future work
